# text-similarity-NLP

- Developed classifiers to detect text similarity between Quora question pairs.
- Applied three word tokenization techniques—SpaCy vectorizer, TF-IDF vectorizer, and Word2Vec—to convert text into numerical representations.
- Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, analyzing their performance across different vectorization methods.
- Achieved the best results using the Word2Vec model, significantly improving classifier performance.
